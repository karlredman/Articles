Throughout my career I've been afforded the opportunity to work with many people of various dialects of English. On many occasions the persons I've worked with do not speak "American" English as a first language. In this article I highlight some things which may help with persons who are trying to communicate across English dialect barriers. However, this article is not about communication through translation -but this perspective may be useful nonetheless.

I'm from the Midwest U.S.A. (Middle Illinois). When I started working as a Systems/Software Engineer in the mid 1990's in Chicago, IL. there was little concern about working with people who spoke "American" English. Over the next 2 decades I worked increasingly with persons of various countries who spoke English as a second-type language. Often we had trouble communicating until we mutually adjusted to one another's English dialects and, otherwise, vocabulary. It doesn't hurt to spend time to learn as much as one can about the language of others (spoken at the very least) but that is not the focus of my commentary here.

## Briefly: My Background:

In the early 2000's I started working with individual persons on an integration project for London and Germany stock exchanges on a regular basis. For weeks we each talked over email in English (my Midwestern flair, the Londoner's slang, and the German's translated version of English). Simultaneously I had taken the position as lead developer for 'Helios' (later bought out by Bear Stearns for the product we developed). One of the members of my team was from Poland, and another was from Russia. After working with the two local individuals (the Polish guy, and the Russian guy) we worked out our language differences. And that's when it dawned on me that there is a kinda of a protocol for establishing communication with people across dialects of English. And, frankly, this was brought about by the fact that the Polish guy and the Russian guy could talk Russian/German interchangeably and fill in what they couldn't communicate otherwise with English.

Since the early 2000's I have not entirely learned any second language. However, given most situations, I can pick up words or phrases that help along a conversation from my point of view. Likewise, my willingness to accept that my understanding of only English is limited -and thus adapt and try to understand both dialect and language usage beyond my comfort zone. And often I have failed -but that's OK because we worked around this in other ways.

Once I applied these methods and worked with others to refine the concepts (on a high level) I found it easier to communicate beyond language boundaries -so long as English is involved in part (I admit this is a limitation I would like to improve upon). However, I've worked with people across the globe otherwise whom I would have struggled with otherwise. This includes people from Spain (EU Spanish), Mid American Spanish Speakers (Mexico, etc.), Brazil (Portuguese), Various Russian areas, China (limited results across dialects), Japan (limited results across dialects), and South Asian Countries (persons with first language: Hindi, Arabic, Urdu). Mind you, I do **not** speak any of these languages beyond a word or two. But I've been able to develop software applications with people from these countries.

## Establish a Communication Protocol

It's important to note that some projects just can't be developed (sans engineered) without a complete understanding of the target language and/or culture. Otherwise, In my bias experience, it's easiest to develop in English (documentation and code [comments, et. al]). While most of the points below will be applicable to other bias we'll assume English is our base standard for the sake of this article.

* Establish a non-judgmental communication method for understanding one another
    * Each person must understand that it's ok to say, non judgementally, 'I don't understand what you are saying / meaning"
* Always attempt to default to English translations for troubled communications -it's a standard that can be used for consideration of 'arguments'
* Acknowledge that team members speak different first-languages
* Acknowledge that team members have different capacities for understanding language dialects
* Always respect the other person when frustrated with one's own understanding
* Establish other methods where understanding and communication break down
    * UML diagrams (in English [or the standardized language thereof])
    * Whiteboard drawings
    * Prototype applications/mockups
* Ask for a translator

When team members understand that communication limitations are part of the process, and that the process must have a standard operating procedure, they tend to work together to form methods among themselves. The key to the whole 'trick' is to respect that people everywhere, regardless of language constraints, have great ideas -and to find ways to work with that paradigm.
