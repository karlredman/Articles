      <title>Golang: Independent Custom Workspaces</title>

      <description>Golang: Independent Custom Workspaces TL;DR: Up to and including go1.13.7, $GOPATH, $GOBIN and the Go toolchain make it very difficult to isolate the Go Workspace for any development / production / runtime environments outside of the Go Contributers&#39; agenda and scope of ideology.
This article attempts to illustrate how one might go about working around these severe Go environment limitations. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of golang and I want to use it in a more wide ranging and versatile real-world environment.</description>

      <title>Resolve docker hostnames from host with DNS Proxy Server</title>

      <description>This article is a continuation of my previous HowTo: Dnsmasq + NetworkManager + Private Network Setup. With just a few configuration changes we will add the capability to interact with docker containers by their respective hostnames. Even though the dns-proxy-server project affords us this new functionality I recommend that dns-proxy-server only be used for development purposes.
While it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to have the ability to reference individual containers by hostname during development efforts the concept doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well.</description>
