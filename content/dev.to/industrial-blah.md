A description of creativity in (software) engineering.

I feel the need to qualify my post here: I hope to make it clear that I'm talking about the world of development; the desire, the want to create, the need to produce and survive as such. I post this not out of some sense of need to showboat or from any sense of relative gratification. This is from my heart. My experience. I hope the reason why I post this here on dev.to is revealed by these following words.

I offer this as an example to use as you see fit -and that is the point.... It's in my personal best interests to convey the hardships of lifestyle type developers -like myself. We're not always employed or in the best positions but we're here, experiencing real life -doing the best that we can -and we're creating new things. You might not be able to see it right now but that is because we're magicians. POOF! it's there or it's not.

I wrote this following poem sometime in 1999 -it was a livejournal post. I'd just been fired / quit from PcQuote (long story -still friends with Mike K. [owner/founder -guy who gave me a start as a software engineer/programmer] who fired me just as I quit.) PCQuote had become Hyperfeed, wiped out ALL of my options (everyone's), flopped on the IPO due to a corporate takeover (...a clue to the time frame I was fired relative to the work I was doing), My boss (Mike K.) was going through a divorce, and so was I. I went on to make more money elsewhere but that's a different story...

This summarized everything I was feeling at the time: Separation in marriage -and from my son, changes in my job, feelings of betrayal from my boss, loss of confidence, etc. I think the words are still relevant. I think these words are apropos.:w


```quote
industrial.blah:

system shock
circuits shorting
synapses firing
lights blinding
osmosis decay
deconstruct
cancers growing
collapse
expand
monkeys in command
rivers flowing
disconnect
reconstruct
time in suspension
a doppelganger friend
self indignation
a lost nation
where does justice prevail?
sugar and tweed
bleed, bleed
animals in cages
made of glass
fairy tails
of things gone by
```
