I come from a blue collar background. I used to drive forklifts and I ran 6 color printing presses before I became a computer software applications engineer during the mid 1990's. Most of the software I've written to date has spanned languages such as C,C++, Bash, Perl, Python, Java, Basic, x86 Assembly, and many others over the years. Most, if not all, of my work has been proprietary -from IPC to realtime web. This is a brief story of my experience with development from mid 1990's through now. I preface this commentary by saying that I've most recently taken 3 years off from all work and 10 years off from (what I consider) hard core development work. I'm currently in the market to develop software as an applications engineer again. This is my story as a 47 year old person without a college education.

In 1994 my son was born. During the same year my wife (then) and I decided that it was in the best interest for my career and our future livelihood that we invest in me skills as a computer programmer. At this time the world wide web was small -very small by today's standards. Most of the information I had about programming computers, being self taught, came from books. This meant a heavy investment in my skills between my (then) wife and myself. At one point I owned over 300 computer programming books -none of the information available beyond newsgroups at the time. I'd read every page of every book and worked though every aspect of the technology I could afford to learn.

At some point this led to, literally, snorting cocaine on top of a water cooler -just because we all wanted to enforce the cliche`.

## General background:

I provide a general background for my progress to becoming a computer programmer [here](https://karlredman.github.io/about_me.html). What I don't mention is the crazy parts. For instance, my first programming job was predicated, through the interview process, on my writing a MFC C++ 'hello world' Windows Application via Borland C++ 3.0. This was easy for me because I'd done so before -I'd spent $400 on Borland C++ 3.0 out of the money received from my marraige in 1992. That's right, out of the $1500 my wife (then) and I collected from our wedding, I took $400 and spent it on Borland C++ 3.0 in 1992 (and actually, I bought it the day of my wedding). At the time I was working blue collar. I knew this was my path -and, begrudgingly, my wife (eventually) supported me.

## What about the crazy you promised?!

In 1995 I landed a job for $20k as a systems administrator for medical applications and hardware (think serial terminals/printers/networks... netware, etc.) but, because it was my 24th birthday, my boss gave me a rase to $24k on the day I was hired. This is how things were back then -I got my first raise based on my age. I worked for this organization for 3 years and worked with SCO, HPUX, ATT, Solaris, Xinix, etc.

1998:
I got my first actual programming job. I had no college education (only a technical school background) and moxxy. I sat in that interview, that fu**ing interview and the owner of the company told me: (actual quote) "You seem to have a lot of enthusiasm but what separate you from anyone that walks in that door? What can you do that a college grad can't?". Well, ugh, that was a killer for me. I was absolutely destroyed. I replied with (something along the lines of) "Give me a task, a 'hello world' in any language in any system and I'll get you that code in 24 hours -if the code works you give me a shot." The guy went for the challenge, told me to send him a MFC compatible C++ 'hello world' (even though he knew I only had Borland C++ -back then frameworks were delicate) program. If I came through I'd get the job. So, I left the interview and went home to learn MFC C++ components and deliver an app via Borland in less than 24 hours -I didn't sleep that day at all. I got the job.

## Where's the cocaine?!

To make a long story shorter...

That first programming job involved developing low level socket client-server systems for realtime financial applications backends. I became a C/C++ IPC cross platform (AIX, Linux, Solaris, Sparc Sun, Windows) network developer/engineer. I can not empathise the amount of stress of being a financial market software engineer in the late 1990's and early 2000's. The work is 24/7. Markets are in flux at this time. And entirely new markets are being created (i.e. My work with Helios/Bear Stearns). This is the time of EVERYONE creating new markets out of 'information first -as fast as you can get it' stock and options trading. It was during my first job as a software engineer that we, developers in the office, regularly held meetings at the water cooler so that we could each snort a line or two of cocaine and go back to work. And then we'd go back to our desks and work for another 10 hours or so. While I was never hooked on the cocaine thing it was a part of the job for several years and several jobs after that.

## OMG Things have Changed!

Thank goodness that things have changed. Where, at one time, I was making $70/hr to have drinks at the W hotel in downtown Chicago for 5 hours per night, just to get the business managers on board with our development work, modern negotiations are (somewhat) lost to history. I'm sure this kind of thing still happens but not on the slight snapshot that I've mentioned. I always honored my marriage but I was definitely offered, on many occasions, any sexual proclivities I might be interested in, any amount of drugs that would perpetuate my performance, and any amount of money that would keep me writing code which would help my bosses take advantage of whatever markets. And, to some degree, aside from the cheating on my wife thing, I took advantage of that culture from 1998-2009. Subsequently I was divorced in 1999, I was a weekend dad for 13 years, I directly contributed to the financial crisis of 2007 (i.e. my work with Bear Stearns), and I wrote programs that hurt people. I was never addicted to the cocaine/drug/drinking/sex that was directly offered to me but I certainly was addicted to the environment. I'm not unknown to this day, for instance, for 'rivet stomping' in a variety of clubs in Chicago -my form for dancing.

## What now?

I Took some time off. I still program a wide variety of languages. The time I took off was in search of myself again -now that my son is an adult. I still enjoy going to concerts and clubs. I'm looking for a junior/sophomore programming job in just about anything in my area -again, finally. I've come to grips with the harm I've caused in my programming in the past -I literally didn't understand that I was causing harm. Obviously that isn't an excuse. I'm just trying to move forward and, hopefully, make amends.
