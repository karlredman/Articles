      <description>Throughout my career I&amp;rsquo;ve been afforded the opportunity to work with many people of various dialects of English. On many occasions the persons I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with do not speak &amp;ldquo;American&amp;rdquo; English as a first language. In this article I highlight some things which may help with persons who are trying to communicate across English dialect barriers. However, this article is not about communication through translation -but this perspective may be useful nonetheless.</description>

      <title>Resolve docker hostnames from host with DNS Proxy Server</title>

      <description>This article is a continuation of my previous HowTo: Dnsmasq + NetworkManager + Private Network Setup. With just a few configuration changes we will add the capability to interact with docker containers by their respective hostnames. Even though the dns-proxy-server project affords us this new functionality I recommend that dns-proxy-server only be used for development purposes.
While it&amp;rsquo;s awesome to have the ability to reference individual containers by hostname during development efforts the concept doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale well.</description>
